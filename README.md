# MyoThreeArm

## What Is It?

ThreeArm is a threejs powered arm model, which can be controlled through code or with the GUI on the side.

## Why?

ThreeArm will be connected to an EMG, in order to visualize results from the EMG and allow users to virtually recreate their arm motions.

## Features

* Control of all four fingers
* Control of thumb
* Double-axis wrist rotation
* Collision detection with `THREE.Mesh` objects
* Awesome GUI interface

## Demo

See the ThreeArm in action [here](http://www.kaufer.org/MyoThreeArm)

Note, this probably won't work without a Myo properly configured. There will be detailed instructions on how to set this up soon.
